This is your parameters text document. Enter in different values below if you would like to change the settings.

!!!!!Do not put any spaces between the settings, equals sign and the value!!!!!!

When first initializing the program there will be a prompt to clear out all objects to create a good background. 
If no background is detected the background distance is set to Max Range at each angle. Be cautious of black objects or edges of corners, 
these will sometimes create ‘null’ values in the data and cause problems. Having an open air condition is best, 
followed by a clear and fixed background that is easily read like a wall. 

Settings will need to be changed because of different situations. A good all-around starting point is set below. 

The program will identify the first object in the field and ignore everything else. This is direction dependent. 
For example, if the direction of spin is set to ccw, the program will give the width of the object to the right of its field of view.
